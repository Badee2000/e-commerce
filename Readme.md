## Security

### Authentication Methods

- API Key: Users can obtain an API key by signing up on our website. The API key should be included in the `Authorization` header of each request.

### Authorization

- Role-based Access Control (RBAC): Different endpoints require specific roles or permissions.

### Input Validation and Sanitization

- I implement strict input validation and sanitization techniques to prevent common security vulnerabilities like NOSQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.

### Rate Limiting

- I have rate limiting in place to prevent abuse and unauthorized usage of the API. Each user is limited to X requests per minute. If you need higher limits, please contact our support team.

### Error Handling

- Our API provides informative error responses with appropriate HTTP status codes. I ensure that sensitive information is not exposed in error messages.

## Schemas and Relationships

Our API utilizes the following schemas, which have relationships between them:

- User: Represents a user in our system. Each user has a unique identifier and associated information such as name, email, and role.

- Product: Represents a Product created by an admin. Each Product has a unique identifier.

- Order: Represents an order made on a product or many products by a user. Each order has a unique identifier, and belongs to a specific user.

- Category: Represents a Category made by an admin. Each comment has a unique identifier and has many products.

The relationships between these schemas are as follows:

- Each user has one or many orders.
- Each category has many products.
- Each order has many products and belongs to a user.
- Each product belongs to a category.

## Methods

The API Has most of the required methods for an e-commerce, such as `CRUD` for users, products, category, drop or add an order and more...

# Email

The API has Email feature to reset password, and I will add the Email feature for validate an account, and maybe some more features.
